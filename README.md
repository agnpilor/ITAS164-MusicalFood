# ITAS164-MusicalFood
ITAS164 Project: 
Arduino Bluetooth - Musical Food 
Project by: Walker Dudeck, Bryan Mercer, Angel Pilor

An Arduino Bluetooth project that uses the Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE to connect into food (i.e.: oranges) and then connects to the Adafruit iPhone App to play musical sounds when the connected food is touched. 
Fruit acts as a touch sensor and relays to the music app on the iPhone and this then converts into musical sounds.
